## Apply for a license

Apply for a business license online or in person through the city or county licensing office. You will need to provide business name, address, type of activity, and owner or responsible party information. Some businesses also need state or professional licenses; the office can direct you to those requirements.

## Renew a license

Business licenses are typically renewed annually. You will receive a renewal notice with the due date and fee. Renew online or in person before the expiration date to avoid late fees or enforcement action. Update the office if your business name, address, or activity changes.

## License types

Common types include general business license, home occupation permit, food establishment license, and street vendor or mobile vendor permit. Requirements and fees depend on the type of business and location. The licensing office can confirm what applies to you.
