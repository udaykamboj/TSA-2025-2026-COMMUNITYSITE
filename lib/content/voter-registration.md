## Register to vote {#register-to-vote}

You can **register to vote** online, by mail, or in person at your local election office or motor vehicle agency (e.g., DMV). You will need to provide your name, address, date of birth, and identification as required by your state. Many states also offer **same-day registration** at polling places on election day—check your state’s rules.

Online registration is available in most states: visit your state’s election website or the national voter registration portal (e.g., vote.gov) and follow the steps. You may need a state-issued ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you register by mail, use the form provided by your state and mail it before the registration deadline. When you renew or update your driver’s license, you can often register or update your registration at the same time.

## Check your status {#check-your-status}

Use your **state’s online voter lookup tool** to confirm that you are registered and to see your **polling place** and **sample ballot**. You can also verify that your address and party affiliation (in states that use it for primaries) are correct and update them if needed. Checking before election day helps avoid surprises—for example, if your polling place has changed or you need to request an absentee ballot after a move.

## Absentee and mail-in voting {#absentee-and-mail-in-voting}

If you cannot vote in person, you may request an **absentee or mail-in ballot**. Deadlines and rules **vary by state**: some require a reason (e.g., travel, illness), others allow any voter to vote by mail. **Request your ballot early** and return it by the stated deadline. Postmarks and drop box locations may be subject to specific rules—some states require receipt by election day, not just postmark. Follow the instructions that come with your ballot (e.g., signature, witness, envelope) to ensure it is counted.

In-person early voting is also available in many states; check your state’s website for dates and locations.

## Frequently asked questions {#frequently-asked-questions}

**When is the registration deadline?** Deadlines are set by each state and may be **15–30 days** before an election. Check your state or local election website for the exact date. Missing the deadline may mean you cannot vote in that election unless your state allows same-day registration.

**Do I need ID at the polls?** Many states require **photo ID** or other forms of identification. Your state’s election site will list what is accepted (e.g., driver’s license, passport, tribal ID). Some states allow alternatives such as a utility bill or signed affidavit if you do not have ID. Check before you go.

**I moved. Do I need to re-register?** **Yes.** Update your registration whenever you change your address so your ballot and polling place are correct. You can usually update online or when you get a new driver’s license. If you moved close to the deadline, check whether you can still vote at your old address or must vote by absentee ballot from your new address.

**I have a felony conviction. Can I vote?** Rules vary by state. Some states restore voting rights after completion of sentence (including parole); others have different rules. Check your state’s election website or a nonpartisan resource (e.g., Restore Your Vote) for current eligibility.
