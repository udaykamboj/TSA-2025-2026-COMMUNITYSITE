## Understand your rights {#understand-your-rights}

In many areas, **rent-stabilized or rent-controlled** units have limits on how much and how often rent can be increased. Landlords must usually give **advance notice** (e.g., 30, 60, or 90 days depending on the amount of increase and local law) before the increase takes effect. Even in **unregulated** (market-rate) units, landlords typically must give notice as required by state or local law and cannot raise rent in a discriminatory or retaliatory manner.

**Check local tenant laws** for your area: rules vary by city and state. Some places have caps on annual increases, require justification for large increases, or give tenants the right to a lease renewal under certain conditions. Your lease may also specify notice requirements. Tenant organizations and legal aid can help you understand what applies to your situation.

## Dispute an increase {#dispute}

If you believe an increase is **illegal or improper** (e.g., no required notice, above the legal limit, or retaliatory because you complained about conditions), you may be able to **file a challenge or complaint**. Document the notice you received (date, amount, effective date) and any relevant lease terms or correspondence. Some jurisdictions have a rent board or housing agency that accepts petitions; others require you to raise the issue in court or with an attorney.

**Tenant organizations** can help you understand your options, deadlines, and the evidence you need. **Legal aid** may be available if you are low-income. Do not refuse to pay rent without legal advice—that can lead to eviction; instead, pay the amount you believe is correct (e.g., the old rent) and seek guidance on how to contest the increase properly.

## Rental assistance {#assistance}

**Rental assistance programs** may help eligible households with **past-due rent** or **ongoing affordability**. Eligibility is often based on income and household size; some programs target families with children, seniors, or people with disabilities. Apply through the designated agency or portal (e.g., state or local housing authority, nonprofit). Waitlists may be long; apply as soon as you qualify and keep your application updated.

Other resources include **emergency rental assistance** (often time-limited), **voucher programs** (e.g., Section 8), and **eviction prevention** funds. Your local housing authority or a tenant resource center can provide information and referrals. Applying for assistance does not replace responding to eviction papers if you are sued—get legal help and respond by the deadline.
