## Apply

Apply for child care assistance through your state or local child care subsidy program—often online, by mail, or at a designated office. You will need to provide household income, family size, work or school schedule, and the provider you plan to use (or need help finding one). Documentation such as pay stubs and proof of enrollment may be required.

## Eligibility

Eligibility is usually based on income, family size, and reason for care (e.g., working, in school, or in job training). There may be limits on the number of hours covered and the types of providers that can be used. Waiting lists are common; apply early and keep your information updated.

## Find approved providers

Subsidy programs maintain lists of approved or licensed providers. You can search by location, age of child, and hours. Some programs allow care by registered family members or in-home providers if they meet program rules.

## Frequently asked questions

**How much will I pay?** Families typically pay a copay based on income; the program pays the rest directly to the provider. Copay amounts vary by state and family size.

**Can I use my current provider?** Only if the provider is approved or willing to become approved by the program. Ask your provider or the assistance office.

**What if I’m on a waiting list?** Keep your application updated and respond to any notices. Some programs offer priority for certain situations (e.g., homelessness, foster care).
