A new health and wellness program aims to improve access to healthcare services for all residents through mobile clinics, telemedicine options, and monthly health fairs. The **Community Health Initiative** is the result of a two-year planning process that brought together the city health department, local hospitals, community health centers, and nonprofit organizations. The goal is to reduce barriers to preventive care and same-day advice, especially in neighborhoods where primary care has been limited and chronic disease rates are high.

## Overview {#overview}

The **Community Health Initiative** launches this month in partnership with local hospitals, community health centers, and nonprofit organizations. The program focuses on **prevention, screenings, and same-day care** in neighborhoods where access to primary care has been limited. Initial funding covers 18 months of operations, with a commitment from partners to seek sustainable funding to make the program permanent and expand hours and locations based on demand.

## Services offered {#services}

The initiative provides:

- **Mobile clinics** — Vans equipped for basic exams, vaccinations (flu, COVID-19, routine adult), and blood pressure and glucose screenings. Stops at libraries, community centers, and senior housing on a rotating schedule. No appointment required for screenings and vaccinations; walk-ups welcome. Staff can refer participants to primary care and specialty services and help with scheduling and paperwork.
- **Telemedicine** — Free video visits with nurses and clinicians for non-urgent issues such as colds, minor injuries, medication questions, and mental health check-ins. Available in multiple languages (Spanish, Mandarin, and others via interpreter); appointments can be booked online or by phone. Same-day and next-day slots are often available.
- **Health fairs** — Monthly events with screenings (blood pressure, glucose, cholesterol by partner organizations), flu shots, and information on nutrition, mental health resources, and enrollment in insurance and benefit programs. Fairs are held at different locations each month to reach a wide audience.
- **Referrals** — Staff help connect residents to primary care providers, specialty care, and social services when needed. Follow-up calls are made when possible to ensure residents were able to access referred care.

## Eligibility {#eligibility}

- **Mobile clinics and health fairs** — Open to **all city residents**. No insurance or ID required for basic screenings and vaccinations. Staff may ask for name and contact information for follow-up and to help with referrals; providing this information is optional for screenings and vaccinations.
- **Telemedicine** — Available to residents who **live in the city** and do not have a regular provider or need same-day advice. Insurance is not required; sliding-scale fees may apply for some follow-up services (e.g., certain lab work or specialist referrals). Minors must have consent from a parent or guardian for telemedicine visits.

Interpretation services are available for major languages; request when booking or at the mobile clinic. American Sign Language interpretation can be arranged for telemedicine with advance notice.

The initiative is funded through a mix of city funds, federal grants, and hospital community benefit commitments. The goal is to make the program permanent and expand hours and locations based on demand and ongoing evaluation.
