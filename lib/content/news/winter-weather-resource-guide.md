Extended hours at city warming centers and additional outreach teams will help residents stay safe during cold weather this season. The city has coordinated with shelters, libraries, recreation centers, and outreach organizations to ensure that everyone has a place to get warm and that vulnerable residents—including those experiencing homelessness—are connected to resources and transport. Residents are encouraged to share this information with neighbors who may need assistance and to call 311 if they see someone in distress during cold weather.

## Overview {#overview}

As winter continues, the city has expanded **warming center hours** and deployed extra outreach teams to connect vulnerable residents with shelter and resources. Cold weather alerts are issued when temperatures fall below 32°F or when wind chill creates dangerous conditions; during alerts, additional sites extend hours and free transportation to warming centers is available. All city residents are encouraged to sign up for alerts at weather.city.gov and to share warming center and shelter information with friends, family, and neighbors.
