The city council has unanimously approved a comprehensive infrastructure improvement plan that will modernize key public facilities and improve transportation networks over the next five years. The vote followed months of public hearings, technical studies, and input from neighborhood associations and business groups. Council members cited the plan's balance of immediate repairs with long-term investments and its reliance on existing funding streams rather than new taxes.

## Key projects {#key-projects}

Highlights of the approved plan include:

- **Road resurfacing** — Over 40 miles of arterial roads will be repaved in the first two years, prioritizing corridors with the highest traffic volumes and worst pavement conditions. The program includes improved drainage and accessibility upgrades at key intersections.
- **Bridge repairs** — Three aging bridges (the North Avenue span, the Riverside crossing, and the East Gate overpass) will receive structural upgrades, new pedestrian walkways, and modernized lighting. Inspections and design work begin this quarter.
- **Community centers** — Two new multipurpose centers will open in underserved neighborhoods: one in the Northside district and one near East Gate. Each will include gym space, meeting rooms, after-school programming, and senior activities. Groundbreaking is scheduled for 2027.
- **Parks and trails** — Expansion of the riverfront trail by 4.5 miles, new playground equipment in five parks, and improved accessibility at entrances and restrooms. The trail extension will connect two existing segments and pass through the new Riverside Apartments development.

The city's Public Works department will lead implementation, with oversight from a new citizen advisory panel that will meet quarterly to review progress and hear community feedback.

Funding for the plan is secured through a combination of federal grants, state matching funds, and existing capital budgets. No new general tax increase is required for this phase. The city will apply for additional federal funding in 2026 and 2027 to accelerate certain projects if grants are awarded.
