City partners with developers to build mixed-income housing across five neighborhoods, with priority for families and essential workers. The **Affordable Housing Expansion** is the largest single commitment to affordable rental housing in the city's history and responds to years of advocacy from residents, housing nonprofits, and employers who have reported difficulty recruiting and retaining workers due to housing costs.

## Overview {#overview}

The **Affordable Housing Expansion** is a multi-year initiative that will create 500 new rental units for low- and moderate-income residents. The city has selected five sites for development, prioritizing neighborhoods with strong transit access and existing community services. Each development will include a mix of unit sizes to serve individuals, couples, and families; a portion of units will be set aside for households with the lowest incomes. All sites will be built to high energy-efficiency and accessibility standards, and developers have committed to local hiring and apprenticeship goals during construction.

> "Every resident deserves a safe, stable place to call home. This expansion represents our commitment to inclusive growth—so that the people who teach our kids, care for our sick, and keep our city running can afford to live here."

Rent levels will be set according to area median income (AMI) and unit size; details will be published when each development opens for applications. All properties will be professionally managed with clear lease terms and maintenance procedures.

## Eligibility and application {#eligibility}

- **Income limits** — Households earning 30–80% of area median income may qualify, depending on the development and unit size. Specific limits (by household size) will be published for each property. Some units are reserved for households at 30–50% AMI and others for 50–80% AMI.
- **Preference** — Families with children, essential workers (healthcare, education, transit, and other designated sectors), and veterans receive preference in lotteries. Documentation of employment or veteran status will be required at application.
- **Application** — A centralized application portal opens in March 2026. Residents can sign up for alerts at housing.city.gov to be notified when each development opens for applications. Paper applications and in-person assistance will be available at city community centers and the housing office.

Units will include one-, two-, and three-bedroom options with modern amenities (e.g., in-unit laundry or building laundry, energy-efficient appliances). All developments will be transit-oriented and include community spaces. Waitlists may be long; applicants are encouraged to apply to multiple developments and to keep their contact information current.
