Residents can now sign up for certification programs in healthcare, technology, and skilled trades—all tuition-free with childcare support. The **City Job Training Program** has trained over 2,000 residents since its launch five years ago, with strong job placement rates and employer partnerships. The 2026 cohort expands offerings in high-demand fields and adds new options for childcare and transportation so that more people can participate.

## Overview {#overview}

The **City Job Training Program** opens enrollment for 2026 with expanded offerings in high-demand fields. All programs are tuition-free for city residents, and eligible participants can receive childcare vouchers and transportation assistance (e.g., transit passes or gas cards for those who must drive). Programs combine classroom instruction with hands-on training and, where applicable, industry certifications that employers recognize. Many programs include internships or job shadows with local employers, and job placement assistance is available upon completion.
