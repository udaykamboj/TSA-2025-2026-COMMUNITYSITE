Enhanced public transportation services will connect underserved neighborhoods starting next month, with three new bus routes and extended service hours across the city. The expansion is the largest single service increase in over a decade and reflects the transit authority's commitment to equity and climate goals. Ridership on pilot corridors grew by 18% during the trial period, with strong support from residents and employers.

## Overview {#overview}

The transit authority announced the expansion after a **year-long pilot** and community feedback from thousands of riders, neighborhood meetings, and an online survey. The new routes fill gaps in the current network and align with the city's goal of **reducing car dependency** and improving access to jobs, schools, healthcare, and services. The authority also cited partnerships with major employers along the new corridors, several of which are expanding transit benefit programs for employees.

> "Reliable transit is essential for our community. These routes are a direct response to what residents told us they need—more frequent service, better connections, and later hours for shift workers and evening activities."

## New routes {#new-routes}

Three new bus routes will launch in March 2026:

- **Route 42 — North Corridor** — Connects the northern neighborhoods to the downtown hub and medical district. Stops include the new community center, two major employers, North Library, and Northside Commons (the upcoming affordable housing development). Expected to serve an estimated 8,000 riders per week.
- **Route 43 — East–West Express** — Links the east side to the west side with limited stops for faster commutes. Peak-hour service every 15 minutes; midday and evening service every 30 minutes. Key stops include East Gate Village, the arts district, and the west-side industrial park.
- **Route 44 — Riverfront Loop** — A circular route along the riverfront, serving parks, housing, and the arts district. Ideal for weekend and evening travel, with connections to the expanded riverfront trail. Runs every 20 minutes on weekends and every 30 minutes on weekdays.

Real-time arrival signs will be installed at the busiest stops on all three routes by the end of 2026. The authority is also evaluating additional shelters and seating based on rider feedback during the first six months.

## Schedule and hours {#schedule}

- **Weekday service** on all three routes: 5:30 a.m. – 10:00 p.m. Route 42 and 43 offer peak-hour frequency of every 12–15 minutes.
- **Saturday and Sunday** on Route 42 and 44: 7:00 a.m. – 8:00 p.m.; Route 43 runs weekday-only initially, with weekend service under consideration for 2027.
- **Extended hours** on existing high-ridership routes: 12 additional routes will run until 11:00 p.m. on weekdays (previously 9:00 or 9:30 p.m.), allowing more flexibility for evening work, education, and recreation.

Schedules and real-time arrival information will be available on the **Transit app**, on the authority's website, and at major stops. Printed schedules will be distributed at libraries and community centers in the weeks before launch.

## Feedback {#feedback}

Riders can share feedback in several ways:

- **Surveys** — Short in-app and on-board surveys will run during the first six months to gather data on trip purpose, frequency, and satisfaction. Participants can opt in to a quarterly drawing for free monthly passes.
- **Public meetings** — Quarterly open houses will be held to discuss ridership, on-time performance, and possible adjustments to schedules or stops. Dates and locations are posted on the transit authority website.
- **311** — Report issues (e.g., missed runs, accessibility concerns, safety) or suggestions by phone or the 311 app. Reports are tracked and used in service planning.

Fares remain unchanged. Youth, seniors, and eligible low-income riders continue to qualify for reduced or free fares through existing programs. The authority is also piloting a fare-capping program on two routes in 2026, so that riders who take multiple trips per day never pay more than the cost of a day pass.
