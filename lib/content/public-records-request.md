## Submit a request

Submit a public records (Freedom of Information / open records) request to the agency that holds the records. Use the agency’s online form, email, or mail as specified on their website. Describe the records you want as clearly as possible so staff can locate them. You may receive a confirmation and a request number.

## What is available

Laws define which government records are public. Common examples include meeting minutes, budgets, contracts, permits, and certain correspondence. Some information is exempt (e.g., personal privacy, ongoing investigations). The agency will identify any withheld portions and the legal basis.

## Response time and fees

Agencies must respond within the time required by state or local law (often 5–30 business days). They may extend the time for complex requests and must notify you. Copy and search fees may apply; the agency will tell you the cost before fulfilling the request. Fee waivers or reductions are sometimes available for certain requesters or uses.
