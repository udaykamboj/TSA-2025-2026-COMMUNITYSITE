## Pay ticket {#pay-ticket}

You can pay your parking or camera ticket online if it has been issued and is in the system. The following violation types can be paid online:

- **Parking ticket** — Issued by parking enforcement for meter violations, no-parking zones, expired registration, or other on-street parking infractions.
- **School zone speed camera violation** — Recorded when a vehicle exceeds the posted speed limit in an active school zone during school hours.
- **Red light camera violation** — Recorded when a vehicle enters an intersection after the traffic signal has turned red.
- **Bus lane camera violation** — Recorded when a vehicle travels in a designated bus-only lane during restricted hours.

You must pay your fine within **30 days** to avoid late fees and possible penalties (e.g., additional fines, booting, or referral to collections). If you need more time, check whether a payment plan is available in the payment portal.

Payment options typically include credit card, debit card, or electronic check. You will need your ticket number and license plate number; the ticket number is printed on the citation and may also be found in a letter sent to the registered vehicle owner.

## Dispute ticket {#dispute-ticket}

If you believe your ticket was issued in error, you may dispute it **online or by mail**. You will need your ticket number and license plate information. Disputes must be submitted within **30 days** of the violation date; late disputes may not be accepted.

Common grounds for dispute include: the vehicle was not yours (e.g., stolen or sold), the plate or violation was misread, the sign or meter was missing or illegible, or you have evidence that you were in compliance (e.g., receipt, photo). Include any supporting documents (photos, receipts, police report) when you submit your dispute. You may receive a decision by mail or through the online portal; some jurisdictions allow an in-person hearing if you request one.

## Check ticket status {#check-ticket-status}

Use the online system to check whether your ticket has been entered and its current status (e.g., paid, pending, in dispute, past due). Status updates may take a few days after the ticket was issued. You can also confirm the amount due and any deadlines. If your ticket does not appear after 5–7 business days, contact the help line with your ticket number and license plate.

## Frequently asked questions {#frequently-asked-questions}

**When will my ticket appear?** Tickets may take **3–5 business days** to appear in the system after they are issued. Camera violations may take slightly longer while images are reviewed. If you recently received a ticket, check back in a few days or contact 311.

**Can I get a payment plan?** Payment plans may be available for eligible individuals. Check the payment portal for options; you may need to apply before the 30-day deadline to avoid penalties while on a plan.

**What if I lost my ticket number?** You can often look up tickets by license plate and state on the city’s ticket payment website. If you still cannot find it, call the help line with your plate number and the approximate date and location of the violation.

**Will this affect my driver’s license or insurance?** Rules vary by jurisdiction and violation type. Parking tickets typically do not affect your license; camera and moving violations might. Check your state’s rules and the notice sent with your ticket.

## Get help {#get-help}

For questions about parking or camera tickets, contact the help line or visit a walk-in center. Bring your ticket number and any supporting documents (e.g., photos, receipts).
