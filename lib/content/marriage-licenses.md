## Apply for a license

Apply for a marriage license in person at the clerk’s office or vital records office in the jurisdiction where you plan to marry. Some localities allow you to start the process online but require in-person completion. Both partners usually must appear and present valid ID.

## Requirements

Requirements vary by location but often include proof of identity and age, and dissolution or death certificates if either party was previously married. Some places require a short waiting period between applying and when the license becomes valid. There may be blood test or premarital education rules in certain states.

## Fees and waiting period

A fee applies for the license. There is often a short waiting period (e.g., 24–72 hours) after application before the license is valid. The license is typically valid for a set period (e.g., 30–90 days); the marriage must be performed within that time and the signed license returned to the issuing office.
