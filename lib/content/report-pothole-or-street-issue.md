## Report an issue {#report-an-issue}

Report **potholes, broken pavement, missing or damaged signs, sinkholes, or other street issues** online through the city’s 311 portal or by calling **311**. Provide the **exact location** (address or cross streets) and a brief description of the issue. You may receive a **reference number** to track the request—save it for follow-up. Reports help the city prioritize repairs and plan maintenance; high-traffic or hazardous areas may be addressed sooner.

For **emergency hazards** (e.g., large sinkhole, downed wires, flooding), call 911 or the appropriate emergency line. For non-emergency but urgent issues (e.g., debris blocking a lane), 311 can route your report for a quicker response.

## What to include {#what-to-include}

Include the **street name**, **nearest address or cross streets**, and the **type of issue** (pothole, crack, sinkhole, broken curb, missing sign, etc.). If it is safe to do so, **a photo** can help crews locate and assess the problem. For hazards that affect **traffic or pedestrians** (e.g., deep pothole in a travel lane, broken sidewalk), note that in the description so it can be prioritized. If you have seen the issue cause damage or near-accidents, you can mention that as well.

You do not need to give your name to submit a report, though some systems allow you to create an account to track your requests and receive status updates.

## Track repair status {#track-repair-status}

Use your **reference number** to check the status of your report **online** (e.g., in the 311 portal under “My Requests”) or by **calling 311**. Response times depend on **severity, season, and workload**. Critical hazards (e.g., large potholes on busy roads, sinkholes) may be addressed quickly, sometimes with a temporary patch followed by a permanent repair. Routine repairs may be scheduled in the next maintenance cycle or when crews are in the area. Weather can delay paving and other work.

If the issue is not addressed within the expected time frame, you can follow up with your reference number. If the condition worsens or causes an incident, you can submit a new report or add to the existing one, depending on how the system works in your city.
