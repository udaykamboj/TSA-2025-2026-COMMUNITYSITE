## Apply {#apply}

You can apply for SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits **online, by mail, or in person** at your local office. The application will ask about your household (who lives with you and shares meals), income (wages, self-employment, child support, benefits, etc.), and expenses (rent, utilities, childcare, medical costs for elderly or disabled members). You may need to provide documents such as ID, pay stubs, rent receipts, and proof of citizenship or immigration status. Many states let you start the application online and upload documents or bring them to an interview.

Applications are typically processed within **30 days**; if you qualify for expedited (emergency) SNAP, you may receive benefits within 7 days. You will be notified by mail or phone about your eligibility, benefit amount, and any required interview (often by phone or in person).

## Eligibility {#eligibility}

Eligibility is based on **household size, income, and certain expenses**. Income limits are set by the federal government and updated annually; most households must be at or below 130% of the federal poverty guideline (gross income), with some deductions allowed. Citizenship and immigration status rules apply: U.S. citizens and certain qualified noncitizens may be eligible. Students, strikers, and some other groups have special rules.

Many states offer **pre-screening tools** online so you can see if you may qualify before applying. Even if you are not sure you qualify, you can submit an application; the agency will determine eligibility. Eligibility can change if your income or household size changes—report changes when they happen.

## Renewal {#renewal}

Benefits are certified for a **set period** (often 6 or 12 months, depending on your situation). You will need to **renew** before the end of that period to continue receiving benefits. You will receive a notice with the renewal deadline and required steps (e.g., complete a renewal form, provide updated income information, or attend an interview). If you miss the deadline, your benefits may stop and you may need to reapply.

Submit your renewal on time and respond to any requests for information. If your circumstances have not changed, renewal is often straightforward. If you have questions, contact your caseworker or the local office before the deadline.

## Frequently asked questions {#frequently-asked-questions}

**How much will I get?** Benefit amounts depend on household size, income, and allowable deductions (e.g., shelter costs). The maximum benefit is set by the federal government; your state will calculate your amount based on your application. You can use online calculators or ask at the office for an estimate.

**Can I use SNAP at farmers markets?** Many farmers markets accept SNAP; some also participate in programs that double SNAP dollars for fruits and vegetables. Ask at your local market or check the state SNAP website.

**What if I am denied?** You have the right to request a fair hearing if you disagree with a denial or a change in your benefits. The denial notice will explain how to appeal and the deadline. Legal aid or advocacy groups may be able to help with the process.
