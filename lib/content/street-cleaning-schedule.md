## Find your schedule

Street cleaning schedules are set by block and side of the street. Enter your address in the city’s street cleaning lookup tool or check the posted signs on your block. Schedules are often weekly or twice monthly and may vary by season or area.

## Parking rules

During posted street cleaning hours, vehicles must be moved off the street or to the side that is not being cleaned. Cars left on the wrong side may be ticketed or towed. Allow time to move your vehicle before the start of cleaning hours.

## Holidays and exceptions

Street cleaning may be suspended on certain holidays or after snow events. The city website or 311 will list suspensions. When in doubt, follow the posted signs on your block or check the official schedule before leaving your car.
