## Apply for a permit

Apply for building permits online or in person at the building department. You will need to submit plans, site information, and applicable fees. Small projects (e.g., fences, sheds) may use a simplified process; larger or structural work typically requires detailed plans and review. Allow time for plan review and any revisions.

## Permit types

Common permit types include new construction, additions, renovations, electrical, plumbing, HVAC, roofing, and demolition. Some work may be exempt (e.g., minor repairs); the building department can confirm what requires a permit in your area.

## Inspections

Required inspections are listed on your permit. Schedule each inspection when the work is ready; failing or missing inspections can delay your project. Inspectors verify that work meets code before you proceed or close out the permit.

## Check permit status

Use the online permit portal or contact the building department to check the status of your application or permit, view inspection results, and see any open items or fees.
