## Report illegal parking

Report vehicles that are parked in no-parking zones, blocking driveways, or violating other parking rules. You can submit a report online with the location and, if possible, the license plate and a photo.

## What to include

- Exact address or cross streets
- License plate number (if visible)
- Description of the violation
- Date and time
- Photo if available

Enforcement response depends on availability and priority. For vehicles blocking access or creating a safety hazard, you may also contact non-emergency dispatch.
