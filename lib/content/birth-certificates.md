## Request a certificate {#request}

You can request a **certified copy** of a birth certificate **online, by mail, or in person** at the vital records office. Certified copies are required for passports, school enrollment, benefits, and many other purposes. Requests are processed in the order received. You will need to provide **identification** and, for some requests, **proof of relationship** to the person named on the certificate (e.g., if you are requesting a child’s certificate or a parent’s).

Online requests are often the fastest: you fill out a form, upload ID, pay the fee, and receive the certificate by mail. Mail-in and in-person options are available for those who prefer them; in-person pickup may be offered for an additional fee. Processing times vary; check the vital records office website for current estimates and expedited options.

## Eligibility {#eligibility}

**Eligible requesters** typically include the person named on the certificate, their parents (named on the certificate), legal guardians, and others with a **documented legal interest** (e.g., legal representative, spouse, adult child, or someone with a court order). Requirements may vary by location and by whether the birth was recently recorded or is an older record. Some states restrict who can receive a certified copy to prevent fraud; you may need to sign an statement under penalty of perjury that you are entitled to the record.

For **restricted or sealed records** (e.g., adoption, name change), special procedures and eligibility rules apply. Contact the vital records office for guidance.

## Fees and processing time {#fees}

**Fees** apply per copy and vary by jurisdiction. There is usually a base fee for the first copy and a lower fee for additional copies in the same order. **Standard processing** may take several weeks (e.g., 2–6 weeks) depending on volume. **Expedited service** may be available for an additional fee (e.g., 24–48 hour or same-day processing for in-person requests). Check the vital records office website for current fees, processing times, and payment methods (credit card, check, money order).

If you need the certificate for a deadline (e.g., passport appointment, school enrollment), request it as early as possible or use expedited service if offered.

## Frequently asked questions {#frequently-asked-questions}

**What if I was born in another state?** You must request the certificate from the state (or city/county) where the birth occurred. Most vital records offices have websites with instructions for out-of-state requests; some accept online or mail-in requests from anywhere.

**What if the birth was not registered?** Late registration of birth is possible in many places. You may need to provide evidence (e.g., hospital record, baptismal record, school records) and complete a delayed birth registration process. Contact the vital records office where the birth occurred.

**Can I get a copy in another language?** Certified copies are usually issued in the official language of the jurisdiction. For translations, you may need to use a certified translator; some agencies require translations for certain uses (e.g., immigration).
