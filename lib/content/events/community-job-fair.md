The Community Job Fair brings together 50+ employers hiring now. Bring your resume, dress for success, and meet recruiters from retail, healthcare, hospitality, construction, and more. Free and open to all job seekers.

## Overview {#overview}

The **Community Job Fair** is a free event at the Central Community Center. Employers from across the region set up tables and are ready to discuss open positions, accept resumes, and in some cases conduct on-the-spot interviews. Job coaches and workforce staff will also be on hand to help with resume tips, application questions, and referrals to training programs.

## Participating employers {#employers}

Employers typically include local hospitals, grocery stores, restaurants, construction and trades companies, childcare centers, and city contractors. A full list of participating employers is posted on the city workforce website the week before the fair and at the door the day of the event. Industries represented often include healthcare, hospitality, retail, skilled trades, and administrative support.

## How to prepare {#prepare}

- **Dress** — Business casual is a good standard. You want to make a positive first impression.
- **ID** — Some employers may ask for ID. Bring a government-issued ID if you have one.
- **Questions** — Prepare a few questions to ask recruiters, such as "What does a typical day look like?" and "What are the next steps in your hiring process?"
