Join neighbors for the Earth Day Community Cleanup. We'll pick up litter along the riverfront and in City Park, leaving our shared spaces cleaner and safer for everyone. All ages welcome; bring the family and wear comfortable shoes.

## Overview {#overview}

The **Earth Day Community Cleanup** is a volunteer event held each April. Volunteers meet at designated spots in City Park and along the riverfront, receive bags and gloves, and spend the morning cleaning up litter and debris. The city provides supplies and disposes of collected waste. No experience needed—just show up ready to help.

## What to bring {#what-to-bring}

- **Clothing** — Long pants and closed-toe shoes are recommended. Dress for the weather; the event runs rain or shine (light rain only; severe weather may cancel).
- **Water** — Bring a reusable water bottle. Water refill stations will be available at the main meetup point.
- **Optional** — Sunscreen, hat, and work gloves if you prefer your own (gloves are provided).

The city provides trash bags, gloves, and basic safety instructions. Minors should be accompanied by an adult or have a signed waiver from a parent or guardian.

## Meetup locations {#meetup}

- **City Park** — Main entrance near the fountain. Check-in and supply pickup from 8:45 AM; cleanup runs 9:00 AM–12:00 PM.
- **Riverfront** — Meet at the River Trail trailhead (off Oak Street). Same schedule: check-in 8:45 AM, cleanup 9:00 AM–12:00 PM.

You can choose either location when you arrive. No pre-registration required, but signing up in advance on the city website helps organizers plan supplies. After the cleanup, light refreshments are provided at the City Park check-in area.
