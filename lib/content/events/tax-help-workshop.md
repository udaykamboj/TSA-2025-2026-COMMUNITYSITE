Free tax preparation assistance is available for families at the Community Center. IRS-certified volunteers can help you complete your return and claim credits you may be eligible for, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit.

## Overview {#overview}

The **Tax Preparation Help** event is part of the city's free tax assistance program. Volunteers trained through the IRS Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program help eligible households file their federal and state returns. The service is free; no fees or "refund anticipation" products. Appointments are recommended but walk-ins may be accepted as capacity allows.

## What to bring {#what-to-bring}

- **ID** — Government-issued photo ID for you and your spouse (if filing jointly).
- **Social Security cards** — For you, your spouse, and any dependents.
- **Income documents** — W-2s, 1099s, and any other income statements. If you're self-employed, bring records of income and expenses.
- **Deductions and credits** — Records for education expenses, childcare, charitable donations, etc., if you have them.
- **Prior-year return** — Helpful but not required.
- **Bank account info** — If you want your refund by direct deposit (routing and account number).

If you're missing something, come anyway; the volunteers can tell you what you need and whether you can file today or need to return with more documents.
