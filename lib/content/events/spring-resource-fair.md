The Spring Resource Fair brings together city agencies and community organizations so you can learn about benefits, housing help, job programs, health services, and more—all in one place. No registration required; drop in anytime during the event.

## Overview {#overview}

The **Spring Resource Fair** is a free, one-day event at the Central Library. Representatives from food assistance programs, housing counselors, workforce development, health departments, and legal aid will have tables with information and sign-up options. Bring your questions and any documents you use when applying for benefits (ID, proof of address, income) if you want to start an application on the spot.

## What to expect {#what-to-expect}

- **Information tables** — Walk the main floor and stop at any table. Staff can explain eligibility, next steps, and required documents.
- **Short workshops** — Optional 20-minute sessions on topics like "Applying for SNAP" and "Rental assistance 101" run on a schedule posted at the door.
- **Language access** — Spanish and other language interpreters will be available; ask at the welcome desk.
- **Privacy** — You can share as much or as little as you like. No one will turn you away for not having paperwork.
