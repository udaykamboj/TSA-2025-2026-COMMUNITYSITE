## File a complaint {#file-complaint}

Tenants can **file a complaint** about unsafe conditions, lack of heat or hot water, pests (e.g., rodents, insects), mold, lead hazards, broken locks, or other **housing code issues**. File online through the city’s housing or code enforcement portal or by phone (e.g., 311 or the housing hotline). You may need to provide your address, landlord or management company information, and a clear description of the problem. Photos and dates can help. You can usually request that your name be kept confidential from the landlord, though the agency may need to disclose it in certain situations (e.g., hearings).

After you file, the city may **inspect** the property. If violations are found, the landlord may receive an order to correct them within a set time. Failure to comply can result in fines or other enforcement. Keep copies of your complaint number and any correspondence.

## Housing standards {#housing-standards}

Rental units must meet **basic health and safety standards**. These typically include:

- **Heat and hot water** — Adequate heat during cold months (often defined by minimum temperature) and hot water in working order.
- **Security** — Working locks on doors and windows; secure common areas.
- **Sanitation** — No pest infestations that the landlord has not addressed; working plumbing; adequate trash disposal.
- **Structure and safety** — No serious leaks, structural hazards, or exposed wiring. Smoke and carbon monoxide detectors as required by law.

If your **landlord has not addressed** violations after notice, the city may inspect and **require repairs**. In some places, you may have the right to withhold rent or pay into escrow under strict procedures—do not withhold rent without legal advice, as the rules vary and mistakes can affect your rights. Tenant organizations or legal aid can explain your options.

## Get help {#get-help}

**Tenant support organizations** can help you understand your rights, draft letters to your landlord, and navigate the complaint process. **Legal aid** may be available for low-income residents facing eviction, serious code violations, or retaliation. Contact your local legal aid office or tenant union; many offer free or low-cost advice. If you are facing **eviction**, respond to any court papers by the deadline and seek legal help immediately—rights and defenses vary by location and situation.

For **emergency conditions** (e.g., no heat in winter, gas leak, major water leak), report to 311 or the appropriate emergency line; the city may respond quickly and order immediate repairs.
